# web-scraping-challenge
web-scraping and data analysis project at university of Toronto


# Description:

The following project tests web-scraping skills using Python( via jupyter notebook) by understanding HTML syntax.

Website URL used for this challenge:
>Part 1 -
> https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html

>Part 2 -
> https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html

Part 1 of the challenge focused on using automated browsing to visit the website, using beautiful soup to extract text elements from said website, and storing these text elements in a Python Dictionary.

Part 2 not only focused on Scraping but also setting up a data frame using Pandas, and then analyzing the data extracted. Additionally, matplotlib was used to visualize some of the analysis.

The following are the graphs plotted post-analysis for the respective asks:
